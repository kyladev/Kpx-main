the src folder is all backend type files like the server itself.

the public folder contains any fake pages you want to be accessible to 
anyone without logging in (if you have that enabled)

my prebuilt pages that i personally use for the fake frontend are stored in the prebuilt folder,
but the templates are stored in the public folder

the main folder has all of the proxy files, but aren't accessible,
they can only get out through the encrypted end point of the server

the logs folder has all logs, you may want to clear these out occasionally,
they are sorted by severity in this order:
1: errors.log - something really went wrong
2: warnings.log - something might be going wrong, more important notifications
3: important.log - important info about the running server
4: info.log - detailed info about the server running
